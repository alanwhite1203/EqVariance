# EqVariance
A variance swap is an instrument which allows investors to trade future realized (historical) volatility against current implied volatility. The Variance Swap pays the difference between observed variance and a strike variance, possibly subject to a cap and a floor. The observed variance is computed from the stock price returns over a series of specified sampling dates.
